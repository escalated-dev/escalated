Escalated is an embeddable support ticket system with SLA tracking, escalation rules, agent workflows, and a customer portal. This repo contains all the shared frontend assets (Vue 3 + Inertia.js) used across every supported backend framework.

**You don't install this package directly.** Start with the backend package for your framework — it handles everything including pulling in these frontend assets.

## Get Started

Pick your framework:

| Framework | Repo | Install |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Laravel** | [escalated-dev/escalated-laravel](https://github.com/escalated-dev/escalated-laravel) | `composer require escalated/escalated-laravel` |
| **Rails** | [escalated-dev/escalated-rails](https://github.com/escalated-dev/escalated-rails) | `gem "escalated"` |
| **Django** | [escalated-dev/escalated-django](https://github.com/escalated-dev/escalated-django) | `pip install escalated-django` |

Each backend repo has full setup instructions — install command, migrations, config, and how to publish these frontend assets into your app.

## What's in This Repo

All the Vue 3 + Inertia.js components that power the Escalated UI. These are identical across Laravel, Rails, and Django — the backend framework renders them via Inertia.
